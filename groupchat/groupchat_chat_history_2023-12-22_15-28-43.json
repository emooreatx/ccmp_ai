Given that this information is not within our training data and is quite specific, we should leverage the BitsaversAgent's expertise in antique computers. The BitsaversAgent can propose the use of functions to locate and retrieve relevant documentation from the bitsavers.org archive, which is known for its extensive repository of historical computing documents.\n\n#### \nSOURCE_AGENT: BitsaversAgent \n####\n\nTo find information on the SEL 810A operation time, I will first use the \"list_bitsavers_files\" function to search for relevant directories or files that may contain the operational manuals or specifications for the SEL 810A. Once we have identified the relevant files, I can then use the \"download_bitsavers_file\" function to retrieve the documents. After obtaining the files, we can use the \"consult_archive_agent\" to extract the specific information about the operation time of the SEL 810A.\n\nLet's begin by listing the files available in the SEL directory on the bitsavers.org FTP server.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function_name\": \"list_bitsavers_files\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"directory_path\": \"/pdf/sel/\"\n  }\n}\n```",
