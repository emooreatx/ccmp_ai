ccmp_ai uses the [Autogen-AGI Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen-agi) on top of the [AutoGen framework](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) for multi-agent conversational systems, towards the goal of discovering and utilizing information in repositories like bitsavers and VTDA to identify, recover, restore, repair, and demonstrate antique computers.


## Features
- **Enhanced Group Chat** üí¨: Modified AutoGen classes for advanced group chat functionalities.
- **Agent Council** üßô: Utilizes a council of agents for decision-making and speaker/actor selection. Based on a prompting technique explored in [this blog post](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/exploring-multi-persona-prompting-for-better-outputs).
- **Agent Team Awareness** üë•: Each agent is aware of its role and the roles of its peers, enhancing team-based problem-solving.
- **Advanced RAG** üìö: Built in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) leveraging [RAG-fusion](https://towardsdatascience.com/forget-rag-the-future-is-rag-fusion-1147298d8ad1) and [llm re-ranking](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/using-llms-for-retrieval-and-reranking-23cf2d3a14b6) implemented via [llama_index](https://www.llamaindex.ai/).
- **Domain Discovery** üîç: Built in domain discovery for knowledge outside of llm training data, currently bitsavers files.
- **Custom Agents** üåü: A growing list of customized agents.

## WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project leverages agents that have access to execute code locally. In addition it is based on the extended context window of gpt-4-turbo, which can be costly. Proceed at your own risk.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
- clone the project:
```bash
git clone this repo
cd ccmp_ai
```
- (optional) create a conda environment:
```bash
conda create --name ccmp_ai python=3.11
conda activate ccmp_ai
```
- install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- add environment variables
  - copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  - copy `OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json.example` to `OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json` and fill in your OPENAI_API_KEY (this will most likely be needed for the example task)
    ```bash
    cp OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json.example OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json
    ```

All set!! üéâ‚ú®
 
*NOTE*: 
- üî¥ visit [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to get your GitHub personal access token (required)
- ‚úÖ visit https://serpapi.com/ to get your own API key (optional)
- ‚úÖ visit https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create to get your own API key (optional)
  
## Getting Started üöÄ

```bash
python ccmp_ai.py
```
Wait until it finishes and it will be ready for you to ask a question.

- If you would first like to see an example of the research/domain discovery functionality:
```bash
python example_research.py
```
- If you want to see an example of the RAG functionality:
```bash
python example_rag.py
```

## TODO üìù

- [ ] Expand research and discovery to support more resources (such as vtda and archive.org)
- [ ] Support chat history overflow. This would reflect a MemGPT like system where the overflow history would stay summarized in the context with relevant overflow data pulled in (via RAG) as needed.
