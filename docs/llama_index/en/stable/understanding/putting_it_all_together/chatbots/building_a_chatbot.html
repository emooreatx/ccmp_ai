In this tutorial, we‚Äôll walk you through building a context-augmented chatbot using a Data Agent. This agent, powered by LLMs, is capable of intelligently executing tasks over your data. The end result is a chatbot agent equipped with a robust set of data interface tools provided by LlamaIndex to answer queries about your data. Note: This tutorial builds upon initial work on creating a query interface over SEC 10-K filings - check it out here. In this guide, we‚Äôll build a ‚Äú10-K Chatbot‚Äù that uses raw UBER 10-K HTML filings from Dropbox. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions related to the 10-K filings. Let‚Äôs first download the raw 10-k files, from 2019-2022. To parse the HTML files into formatted text, we use the Unstructured library. Thanks to LlamaHub, we can directly integrate with Unstructured, allowing conversion of any text into a Document format that LlamaIndex can ingest. First we install the necessary packages: Then we can use the UnstructuredReader to parse the HTML files into a list of Document objects. We first setup a vector index for each year. Each vector index allows us to ask questions about the 10-K filing of a given year. We build each index and save it to disk. To load an index from disk, do the following Since we have access to documents of 4 years, we may not only want to ask questions regarding the 10-K document of a given year, but ask questions that require analysis over all 10-K filings. To address this, we can use a Sub Question Query Engine. It decomposes a query into subqueries, each answered by an individual vector index, and synthesizes the results to answer the overall query. LlamaIndex provides some wrappers around indices (and query engines) so that they can be used by query engines and agents. First we define a QueryEngineTool for each vector index. Each tool has a name and a description; these are what the LLM agent sees to decide which tool to choose. Now we can create the Sub Question Query Engine, which will allow us to synthesize answers across the 10-K filings. We pass in the individual_query_engine_tools we defined above, as well as a service_context that will be used to run the subqueries. We use a LlamaIndex Data Agent to setup the outer chatbot agent, which has access to a set of Tools. Specifically, we will use an OpenAIAgent, that takes advantage of OpenAI API function calling. We want to use the separate Tools we defined previously for each index (corresponding to a given year), as well as a tool for the sub question query engine we defined above. First we define a QueryEngineTool for the sub question query engine: Then, we combine the Tools we defined above into a single list of tools for the agent: Finally, we call OpenAIAgent.from_tools to create the agent, passing in the list of tools we defined above. We can now test the agent with various queries. If we test it with a simple ‚Äúhello‚Äù query, the agent does not use any Tools. If we test it with a query regarding the 10-k of a given year, the agent will use the relevant vector index Tool. Finally, if we test it with a query to compare/contrast risk factors across years, the agent will use the Sub Question Query Engine Tool. Now that we have the chatbot setup, it only takes a few more steps to setup a basic interactive loop to chat with our SEC-augmented chatbot! Here‚Äôs an example of the loop in action: Take a look at our corresponding notebook. ü¶ô import os import openai os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..." openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] import nest_asyncio nest_asyncio.apply() # NOTE: the code examples assume you're operating within a Jupyter notebook. # download files !mkdir data !wget "https://www.dropbox.com/s/948jr9cfs7fgj99/UBER.zip?dl=1" -O data/UBER.zip !unzip data/UBER.zip -d data !pip install llama-hub unstructured from llama_hub.file.unstructured.base import UnstructuredReader from pathlib import Path years = [2022, 2021, 2020, 2019] loader = UnstructuredReader() doc_set = {} all_docs = [] for year in years: year_docs = loader.load_data( file=Path(f"./data/UBER/UBER_{year}.html"), split_documents=False ) # insert year metadata into each year for d in year_docs: d.metadata = {"year": year} doc_set[year] = year_docs all_docs.extend(year_docs) # initialize simple vector indices from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, ServiceContext, StorageContext index_set = {} service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(chunk_size=512) storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults() cur_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents( doc_set[year], service_context=service_context, storage_context=storage_context, index_set[year] = cur_index storage_context.persist(persist_dir=f"./storage/{year}") # Load indices from disk from llama_index import load_index_from_storage storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults( persist_dir=f"./storage/{year}" cur_index = load_index_from_storage( storage_context, service_context=service_context from llama_index.tools import QueryEngineTool, ToolMetadata individual_query_engine_tools = [ QueryEngineTool( query_engine=index_set[year].as_query_engine(), metadata=ToolMetadata( name=f"vector_index_{year}", description=f"useful for when you want to answer queries about the {year} SEC 10-K for Uber", ), for year in years ] from llama_index.query_engine import SubQuestionQueryEngine query_engine = SubQuestionQueryEngine.from_defaults( query_engine_tools=individual_query_engine_tools, query_engine_tool = QueryEngineTool( query_engine=query_engine, name="sub_question_query_engine", description="useful for when you want to answer queries that require analyzing multiple SEC 10-K documents for Uber", tools = individual_query_engine_tools + [query_engine_tool] from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAgent agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(tools, verbose=True) response = agent.chat("hi, i am bob") print(str(response)) Hello Bob!

Documentation hosted by Read the Docs Back to top Edit this page How to Build a ChatbotÔÉÅ LlamaIndex serves as a bridge between your data and Large Language Models (LLMs), providing a toolkit that enables you to establish a query interface around your data for a variety of tasks, such as question-answering and summarization. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll walk you through building a context-augmented chatbot using a Data Agent. This agent, powered by LLMs, is capable of intelligently executing tasks over your data. The end result is a chatbot agent equipped with a robust set of data interface tools provided by LlamaIndex to answer queries about your data. Note: This tutorial builds upon initial work on creating a query interface over SEC 10-K filings - check it out here. ContextÔÉÅ In this guide, we‚Äôll build a ‚Äú10-K Chatbot‚Äù that uses raw UBER 10-K HTML filings from Dropbox. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions related to the 10-K filings. PreparationÔÉÅ import os Ingest DataÔÉÅ Let‚Äôs first download the raw 10-k files, from 2019-2022. To parse the HTML files into formatted text, we use the Unstructured library. Thanks to LlamaHub, we can directly integrate with Unstructured, allowing conversion of any text into a Document format that LlamaIndex can ingest. First we install the necessary packages: Then we can use the UnstructuredReader to parse the HTML files into a list of Document objects. Setting up Vector Indices for each yearÔÉÅ We first setup a vector index for each year. Each vector index allows us to ask questions about the 10-K filing of a given year. We build each index and save it to disk. To load an index from disk, do the following Setting up a Sub Question Query Engine to Synthesize Answers Across 10-K FilingsÔÉÅ Since we have access to documents of 4 years, we may not only want to ask questions regarding the 10-K document of a given year, but ask questions that require analysis over all 10-K filings. To address this, we can use a Sub Question Query Engine. It decomposes a query into subqueries, each answered by an individual vector index, and synthesizes the results to answer the overall query. LlamaIndex provides some wrappers around indices (and query engines) so that they can be used by query engines and agents. First we define a QueryEngineTool for each vector index. Each tool has a name and a description; these are what the LLM agent sees to decide which tool to choose. Now we can create the Sub Question Query Engine, which will allow us to synthesize answers across the 10-K filings. We pass in the individual_query_engine_tools we defined above, as well as a service_context that will be used to run the subqueries. Setting up the Chatbot AgentÔÉÅ We use a LlamaIndex Data Agent to setup the outer chatbot agent, which has access to a set of Tools. Specifically, we will use an OpenAIAgent, that takes advantage of OpenAI API function calling. We want to use the separate Tools we defined previously for each index (corresponding to a given year), as well as a tool for the sub question query engine we defined above. First we define a QueryEngineTool for the sub question query engine: Then, we combine the Tools we defined above into a single list of tools for the agent: Finally, we call OpenAIAgent.from_tools to create the agent, passing in the list of tools we defined above. Testing the AgentÔÉÅ We can now test the agent with various queries. If we test it with a simple ‚Äúhello‚Äù query, the agent does not use any Tools. If we test it with a query regarding the 10-k of a given year, the agent will use the relevant vector index Tool. Finally, if we test it with a query to compare/contrast risk factors across years, the agent will use the Sub Question Query Engine Tool. Setting up the Chatbot LoopÔÉÅ Now that we have the chatbot setup, it only takes a few more steps to setup a basic interactive loop to chat with our SEC-augmented chatbot! Here‚Äôs an example of the loop in action: NotebookÔÉÅ Take a look at our corresponding notebook.
